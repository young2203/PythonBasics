#The Frame widget is very important for the process of grouping and organizing 
#other widgets in a somehow friendly way. It works like a container, which is 
#responsible for arranging the position of other widgets. It uses rectangular 
#areas in the screen to organize the layout and to provide padding of these 
#widgets. A frame can also be used as a foundation class to implement complex 
#widgets.
#
#
#Here is the simple syntax to create this widget âˆ’
# w = Frame ( master, option, ... )
#
#Parameters
#    master: This represents the parent window.
#    options: Here is the list of most commonly used options for this widget. 
#    These options can be used as key-value pairs separated by commas.
#        The options and the corresponding functions are:
#        bg	The normal background color displayed behind the label and indicator.
#        bd 	The size of the border around the indicator. Default is 2 pixels.
#        cursor	If you set this option to a cursor name (arrow, dot etc.), 
#                the mouse cursor will change to that pattern when it is over the checkbutton.
#        height	The vertical dimension of the new frame.
#        highlightbackground	Color of the focus highlight when the frame does not have focus.
#        highlightcolor	Color shown in the focus highlight when the frame has the focus.
#        highlightthickness	Thickness of the focus highlight.
#        relief	With the default value, relief=FLAT, the checkbutton does not stand out 
#                from its background. You may set this option to any of the other styles
#        width	The default width of a checkbutton is determined by the size of the 
#                displayed image or text. You can set this option to a number of characters 
#                and the checkbutton will always have room for that many characters.
